# Nanopolysaccharide-Builder
Nanopolysaccharide Builder (NPB) is a Python-based package that enables the automatic generation of nanopolysaccharide structures with customizable biochemical topologies. NPB currently supports three model types: cellulose, chitin, and polysaccharide bundles. For each generated structure, corresponding topology files are provided, with support for both GLYCAM06j and CHARMM36 force fields.
