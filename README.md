# Nanopolysaccharide-Builder
![image](https://github.com/Hugo-Wan/Nanopolysaccharide-Builder/blob/main/icon/toc.png)
Nanopolysaccharide Builder (NPB) is a Python-based package that enables the automatic generation of nanopolysaccharide structures with customizable biochemical topologies. NPB currently supports three model types: cellulose, chitin, and polysaccharide bundles. For each generated structure, corresponding topology files are provided, with support for both GLYCAM06j and CHARMM36 force fields. The generated files can be used for atomistic simulations and also include related static correlation functions for X-ray applications, such as diffraction studies.

## ‚ú® Features

1. **Automated File Generation**  
   Automatically generates geometry coordinate files (PDB) and topology files:  
   - **PSF** format for CHARMM36  
   - **PRMTOP** format for GLYCAM06

2. **Versatile Cross-Section Shapes**  
   Supports cellulose and chitin models with a variety of cross-sectional geometries, including:  
   - Hexagonal  
   - Square  
   - Parallelogram  
   - Rectangle  
   
   These shapes reflect the structural diversity found in biological load-bearing systems such as plant cell walls, fungal cell walls, and arthropod cuticles.

3. **Customizable Surface Modification**  
   Enables chemical modification of surfaces on selected crystallographic planes, allowing the design of user-defined nanopolysaccharide architectures.

4. **Microfibril Bundle Construction**  
   Facilitates construction of cellulose microfibril bundle models with support for:  
   - Parallel arrangements  
   - Antiparallel arrangements  

   > üî¨ *Currently supports cellulose only; support for chitin bundles is planned.*

üß™ *Extensible Nanopolysaccharide Support:*  
Support for **hemicellulose**, and its integration with **lignin** and **tannins**, is currently under development.


## üì¶ Requirements

### üîß Required Python Packages (for running NPB)

To run the NPB toolkit, the following Python packages and tools must be installed:

- Python 3.10
- PySide
- NumPy
- PyQt5
- MDAnalysis
- VMD-Python
- psfgen
- AmberTools

> üí° We recommend installing these via Conda for compatibility and ease of setup.

### üöÄ External Simulation Engines (optional)

The following molecular dynamics engines are **not required to run NPB**, but are supported for running simulations using the files generated by NPB:

- NAMD 3.0
- GROMACS
- AMBER
- LAMMPS


## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

We recommend installing **NPB** on a Linux system such as **Rocky Linux**, **Ubuntu**, or other compatible distributions. For best compatibility, your Linux architecture should be **x86_64**.

- **Windows users**: It is recommended to run NPB using a virtual machine (e.g., VMware) or via **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**.
- **macOS users**: NPB has been successfully tested on both **Intel-based macOS (x86_64)** and **Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3 - arm64)** systems.

If you encounter any issues during installation, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/Hugo-Wan/Nanopolysaccharide-Builder/issues) or submit a [pull request](https://github.com/Hugo-Wan/Nanopolysaccharide-Builder/pulls).


For **Linux users**, installation can be completed using **Conda**. We recommend installing [Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install#linux-terminal-installer) and creating a dedicated Conda environment for NPB to ensure a clean and conflict-free setup.

````
# Create a new environment with Python 3.10
conda create --name npb python=3.10 requests (optional)

# Activate the environment
conda activate npb (optional)

# Unzip the compressed zip file of NPB
unzip Nanopolysaccharide-Builder.zip

# Navigate to the extracted NPB directory:
cd /Path/to/Nanopolysaccharide-Builder

# Install the NPB package:
python setup.py install
````

## üöÄ Usage

To launch the NPB graphical interface, open your terminal, navigate to the NPB directory, and run:
````
python gui.py
````
