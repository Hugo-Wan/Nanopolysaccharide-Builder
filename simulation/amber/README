step 1. conda activate npb (or other virtual env. containing AmberTools)



optional step for solvation and adding ions for running simulation. If you want to do the simulation in dry state, skip this step (not recommended)
step 2. type: python fcm.py


Energy Minimization step using Amber


Equilibrium step using Amber


Production step using Amber after eq step is finished
